# Go Examples

## about

My first contact with [golang](http://golang.org) was in 2009, but then we went different ways. Now i want work again with golang and help others with their first contact. These examples explain the basics of golang.  
There will be more examples from time to time.

## install go(lang)

with [homebrew](http://mxcl.github.io/homebrew/):

```
sudo brew install go
```

with [apt](http://packages.qa.debian.org/a/apt.html)-get:

```
sudo apt-get install golang
```

## examples

print Hello World with comments

```
go run HelloWorld.go
```

declare variables and print them

```
go run var.go
```

declare array and print it's items

```
go run array.go
```

do something multiple times

```
go run for.go
```

return the current time/date in various formats

```
go run time.go
```

return pseudo random integer values

```
go run random.go
```

concat strings in two different ways

```
go run cat.go
```

read via cli provided input data

```
go run args.go string string2
```

if statement in golang

```

```

modulo operation finds the remainder of division

```

```

split a string by another string and make an array from the result

```

```

split a string via regular expression and make an array from the result

```

```

calculate and print the fibonacci numbers

```
go run fibonacci.go
```

calculate and print the requested (32th) prime number

```

```

pop and push in golang

```

demonstrate the power of multithreading / parallel computing  
you have to set GOMAXPROCS to something greater than 1 to see any effect

```
export GOMAXPROCS=8
time go run parallel.go true
time go run parallel.go false
```

## compile

One great aspect of golang is, that you can start go applications via ```go run name.go```, but also compile it to an executable with ```go build name.go```. After that you can start the compiled version which starts much faster.
If you start fibonacci.go and the compiled version you will notice, that the last line which contains the execution time doesn't differ much, but if you start it with ```time ./fibonacci 32``` and ```time go run ./fibonacci.go 32``` you will see the difference.
